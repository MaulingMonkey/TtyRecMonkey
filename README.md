## Project Layout

### PuttyDLL

PuttyDLL is a native C project which is almost a direct replica of PUTTY.DSP project from the official PuTTY source code.

Key differences:

- It's been converted to a VS2008 project via the upgrade manager (which worked flawlessly)
- It now generates DLLs instead of EXEs
- _*_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE have been added to supress warning spam from standard library functions
- export.c has been added which exposes methods for PuttySharp (C#) to PInvoke
- Other source files may be modified to expose more to export.c -- should be mostly cosmetic/making availbe outside the TU


### PuttySharp

PuttySharp is a C# library which wraps the methods exposed by PuttyDLL for easier consumption in C#

It is currently small enough that it ended up well commented and designed.  This probably won't last very long.


### ShinyConsole

ShinyConsole is a C# program which provides and tests SlimDX/D3D9 based console text rendering

It is crufty and in need of sanitization.

It is used as a library by TtyPlayer, despite being a program.



### TtyRecMonkey

TtyRecMonkey is the main C# program which is the point of this project.  It is not well written.

It currently handles:

- Parsing (to be spin off?) of TtyRecs
- Basic playback of TtyRecs
